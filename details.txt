### BodyCameras reduce Police Force - https://www.bja.gov/bwc/pdfs/14-005_Report_BODY_WORN_CAMERAS.pdf

- Use of BWC's (body cameras) in one study reduced "use-of-force" incidents by 59%
- Use of BWC's (body cameras) in one study reduced citizens complaints by 87.5%

 Shifts without cameras were twice as
likely to experience incidents of use-of-force as shifts with cameras. 

The City also detected large before-and-after reductions in the prevalence of use-offorce
incidents: A 64.28 percent reduction from 2009, 61.53 percent from 2010, and 58.33
percent from 2011. The City found that the rate of use-of-force incidents per 1,000 contacts was
reduced by 2.5 times in comparison to 12 months prior to the experimental period. Rialto
noticed a sizable reduction in the number of citizens’ complaints against its officers as well.

The City documented an overall reduction in terms of citizens’ complaints. One year
prior to the study, citizens filed 24 complaints. During the study, citizens only filed 3
complaints. This broke down to 0.70 complaints per 1,000 interactions compared to .069 per
1,000 interactions. The raw year-to-year reductions suggests 91.66% fewer cases compared to
2009, 94.11 percent compared to 2010, and 89.28 percent compared to 2011

### Do body cameras chage how police interact with the public? - http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/body-cameras-police-interact-with-public

In San Diego, for example, a 2015 report based on preliminary statistics showed that body cameras helped reduce “personal body” force by officers by 46.5%.

A September 2015 study published in the Journal of Experimental Criminology used a controlled experiment with the Mesa Police Department in Arizona to determine how body cameras influence police-citizen interactions.

Key findings:

- Officers who did not wear body cameras conducted more “stop-and-frisks” and made more arrests than officers who wore the video cameras. Officers who did not wear cameras performed 9.8% more stop-and-frisks and made 6.9% more arrests.
- Officers assigned to wear cameras issued 23.1% more citations for ordinance violations than those who did not wear cameras.
- Officers with body cameras initiated 13.5% more interactions with citizens than those who did not wear them.
- Officers wearing cameras were 25.2% more likely to perceive the devices as being helpful during their interactions with the public.
- The cameras did not have a significant impact on whether or not officers gave verbal warnings to citizens.


### Mapping police violence - http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/compare-police-departments

 - From Jan 2013 to Sept 2016, there were 7 police killings within the Boston Police Department's jurisdiction
 - 28% of U.S. police killings between Jan 2013 - Sept 2016 were committed by police departments of the 100 largest U.S. cities.
 - Black people were 40% of people killed by these 100 police departments despite being only 21% of the population in their jurisdictions.
 - Only 3 of the 100 largest city police departments did not kill anyone from Jan 2013 - Sept 2016 (Buffalo, Irvine, and Plano).
 - The majority (51%) of unarmed people killed by the 100 largest city police departments were black. These police departments killed unarmed black people at a rate 4 times higher than unarmed white people.
 - Rates of violent crime in cities did not make it any more or less likely for police departments to kill people. For example, Buffalo and Newark police departments had low rates of police violence despite high crime rates while Spokane and Bakersfield had relatively low crime rates and high rates of police violence.

### Things you should know about Police Body Camearas in Boston - http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/09/12/boston-police-body-camera-pilot-program-overview

- As of the writing of this article (September 12, 2016) 100 BPD officers are now equipped.
- At launch, ZERO officers voluneteered - so Dr. Anthony Braga, who heads the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University selected 100 - 
  -- According to the department, 55 are white, 29 are black, 13 are Latino, and three are Asian. And 87 of the 100 officers are men.
- The officer gits to choose when the camera is on/off - but they are allowed to record all contact with all civilians.  "The policy gives officers discretion not to record in some instances where there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy — like locker rooms, hospitals or places of worship."


### Implementing a Body-Worn Camera Program Recommendations and Lessons Learned - https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/472014912134715246869.pdf

Body-worn camera results for
Rialto (California) Police Department
- 60 percent reduction in officer use of force
incidents following camera deployment
-  Half the number of use of force incidents
for shifts with cameras compared to shifts
without cameras
-  88 percent reduction in number of citizen
complaints between the year prior to and
following camera deployment

Body-worn camera results for
Mesa (Arizona) Police Department
-  Nearly 3x more complaints against officers
without cameras, eight months after camera
deployment
-  40 percent fewer total complaints for officers
with cameras during pilot program
- 75 percent fewer use of force complaints for
officers with cameras during pilot program

In Daytona Beach, Chief Chitwood requested that the officers with a history of complaints be
among the first to be outfitted with body-worn cameras. Although he found that usually the videos
demonstrated that “the majority of the officers are hardworking, good police,” he has also seen how
body-worn cameras can help an agency address discipline problems. Chitwood said:
We had an officer who had several questionable incidents in the past, so we outfitted him
with a camera. Right in the middle of an encounter with a subject, the camera goes blank,
and then it comes back on when the incident is over. He said that the camera malfunctioned,
so we gave him another one. A week later he goes to arrest a woman, and again, the camera
goes blank just before the encounter. He claimed again that the camera had malfunctioned.
So we conducted a forensic review of the camera, which determined that the officer had
intentionally hit the power button right before the camera shut off. Our policy says that if
you turn it off, you’re done. He resigned the next day.
