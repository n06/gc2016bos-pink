BodyCameras reduce Police Force - https://www.bja.gov/bwc/pdfs/14-005_Report_BODY_WORN_CAMERAS.pdf

- Use of BWC's (body cameras) in one study reduced "use-of-force" incidents by 59%
- Use of BWC's (body cameras) in one study reduced citizens complaints by 87.5%

 Shifts without cameras were twice as
likely to experience incidents of use-of-force as shifts with cameras. 

The City also detected large before-and-after reductions in the prevalence of use-offorce
incidents: A 64.28 percent reduction from 2009, 61.53 percent from 2010, and 58.33
percent from 2011. The City found that the rate of use-of-force incidents per 1,000 contacts was
reduced by 2.5 times in comparison to 12 months prior to the experimental period. Rialto
noticed a sizable reduction in the number of citizens’ complaints against its officers as well.

The City documented an overall reduction in terms of citizens’ complaints. One year
prior to the study, citizens filed 24 complaints. During the study, citizens only filed 3
complaints. This broke down to 0.70 complaints per 1,000 interactions compared to .069 per
1,000 interactions. The raw year-to-year reductions suggests 91.66% fewer cases compared to
2009, 94.11 percent compared to 2010, and 89.28 percent compared to 2011
